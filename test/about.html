                                    FEA is a dynamic organization developing English and employability skills in the framework of building critical thinking skills and enabling personal development. At the root of this work is a contemporary teaching and learning strategy that is far removed from what is usually seen in the developing world. Instead of the "chalk and talk" model, facilitators support and encourage active learning in an informal yet disciplined learning environment.

                                    The programs are free to all, and learning takes place in small centers, often single rooms, close to where the students live. They're open from early in the morning until late at night, so students can fit classes around work or study. In our programs, students develop their ability to ask critical questions rather than unquestioningly accepting the information provided to them. Students gain a sense of self-determination, confidence, and a desire to continue to explore

                        The AAM Foundation, which operates Freedom English Academy, was founded in 1999 in India and the United States by Deepak Chopra. This is the story.

                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.7s" data-wow-duration="1s">
                        <span class="start-qoute">“</span>As a teenager, I walked to my school bus stop through a very low-income neighborhood. Every day, I saw people cooking, eating, and living their lives on the side of the streets. The wretched conditions they were living in bothered me, and I felt a need to help address this problem.
                    </p>
                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.9s" data-wow-duration="1s">
                        As I started my final year of high school, I decided I wanted to go to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT), which had a reputation for being a difficult engineering school to get into. Most students who got into IIT were typically in the top 2-3 of their high school class. I had never been even in the top 20 of any class.
                    </p>
                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.5s" data-wow-duration="1s">
                        So I spent my final year of high school taking as many extra classes as I could and doing everything I could think of to help prepare for the entrance exam. I gave up watching cricket matches, movies and television. Instead, I joined multiple entrance exam preparation classes. I would get up at 4:30 AM and travel 2 hours to the living room of a gifted mathematics teacher, to learn with him before I went to school. I skipped the annual family summer vacation, so that I could focus on studying. That entire year I focused deeply on preparing for this single examination so I could have a chance to attend IIT.
                    </p>
                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.7s" data-wow-duration="1s">
                        And at the end of the year, I was accepted. Having gotten into that university transformed mycareer options and brought many opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.9s" data-wow-duration="1s">
                        In part, this was because the reputation and quality of instruction at IIT. These two things opened doors for me as I was starting my career. But just as important, I developed a sense of self-confidence and inner strength. I had proven to myself that I could achieve something that was considered difficult. My mindset became one of self-reliance and a belief in my own abilities.
                    </p>
                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.5s" data-wow-duration="1s">
                        That last year of intensive studying in high school paid off. This led me to think that in an average person's education, one intensive year of extra learning opportunities can have a significant impact on their career. Through the work of FEA, I am seeking to provide that oneyear experience to as many people as possible, with the<span class="end-quote">”</span> hope that it will make a significant and lasting impact in their lives.
